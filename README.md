# python_csvfile_mysql

Assignment 2:
We will deal with two data sources in this use case where first will be a CSV file and second  MySQL table .
We need to generate a department csv file having columns deptId,deptName (If already not generated). Read employee table from MySQL and lookup deptName from a CSV to get deptName.
We need to show second highest salary for each department where output should have empId, empName,Salary,deptName. NOTE: Use panda to read CSV and Postgres table .
